# Google APIs
Search field and interactive map are no longer active due to
google's billing requirement. It means you can no longer search
or select places on the map, but I have included pictures and videos
to show how the was like when it Google APIs were active.

# Version
You may notice that the version on this repository is not the same as the version you see in the video.  
I have improved upon it to make it look more user-friendly.
